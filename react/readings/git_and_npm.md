# Using Git with NPM

Now that we've started using npm and Webpack, we'll consistently have two large
objects in our project directory. The first is the `node_modules` folder. Good
practice using npm is to not check your `node_modules` folder into version
control. This can be regenerated when needed by simply
running `npm install` in the project directory.

In addition, Webpack's output file is fairly massive and small changes in your
application will propogate into huge `git diff`'s. For this reason, we recommend
also not checking your `bundle.js` into git. This can also be regenerated by
anyone cloning the repo by running `webpack` after running `npm install`.

When starting a project, remember to add both of these to your `.gitignore` file.

Adding to a `.gitignore` is really simple. Just write the file/directory name on its 
own line in your `.gitignore`. As for syntax, `*` are wildcards that match anything 
(within that directory). `#` marks comments. If you want a template, here's an 
[example][gitignore-example].
