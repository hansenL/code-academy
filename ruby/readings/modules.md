# Node Modules

## Quick Hits

So far, we've written all our code in a single file. We'd like to learn
how to split code up in Node modules.

Node is different from Ruby. In Ruby, you can do like so:

```ruby
# ./cat.rb
class Cat
  def meow
    # ...
  end
end

# ./dog.rb
class Dog
  def bark
    # ...
  end
end

# ./animals.rb
require_relative "cat"
require_relative "dog"

cat = Cat.new
dog = Dog.new

cat.meow
dog.bark
```

In Node, things are a little different:

```js
// ./cat.js
function Cat () {
  // ...
};

Cat.prototype.meow = function () {
  // ...
};

module.exports = Cat;

// ./dog.js
function Dog () {
  // ...
};

Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
  // ...
};

module.exports = Dog;

// ./animals.js
var Cat = require("./cat");
var Dog = require("./dog");

var cat = new Cat();
var dog = new Dog();

cat.meow();
dog.bark();
```

## In Detail: Exporting a Class

Node uses `require` to allow one JS file to load a second JS file. For
instance, `animals.js` used `require("./cat")` to load the `cat.js`
file.

When a file is `require`d, Node loads and executes its code. Normally,
required files will define classes, like `cat.js` and `dog.js` defined
`Cat` and `Dog` classes.

That is all more or less the same as in Ruby, but note that in the JS
example, we store the result of `require` in a variable, and we use that
variable to access the module. That's because unlike Ruby's `require`,
Node's `require` does not import a module's global scope:

```js
// DOES NOT WORK

// ./cat.js
function Cat () {
  // ...
}

// ./animals.js
require("./cat");

Cat //=> undefined
```

So how do we export `Cat` from the module file? By setting
`module.exports`. `module` is a pre-defined variable set up by Node,
and its `exports` property is returned whenever we `require` it from
another file. Let's have a look:

```js
// ./silly.js
module.exports = "THIS IS MY EXPORTED STRING";

// ./main.js
var silly = require("./silly");
console.log(silly); //=> THIS IS MY EXPORTED STRING
```

Because the value of `module.exports` is what is returned by `require`,
`cat.js` exports the `Cat` constructor function by setting
`module.exports = Cat` and `animals.js` calls
`var Cat = require("./cat");` to save the `Cat` class to a variable to
use.

## In Detail: Loading Multiple Classes

The above pattern works great if each source file has a single class to
export. What if we want to define many chess pieces?

```js
// ./lib/pieces/pawn.js
function Pawn () {};
// ...
module.exports = Pawn;

// ./lib/pieces/knight.js
function Knight () {};
// ...
module.exports = Knight;

// ./lib/pieces/bishop.js
function Bishop () {};
// ...
module.exports = Bishop;

// ... more piece files ...

// ./lib/chess-board.js
var Pawn   = require("./pieces/pawn");
var Knight = require("./pieces/knight");
var Bishop = require("./pieces/bishop");
// ...

var p = new Pawn();
var k = new Knight();
var b = new Bishop();
```

This is kind of annoying. Anyone who wants to use all of our pieces
needs to load them by hand.

There is a common trick. In addition, to our `./pieces/pawn.js`,
`./pieces/knight.js`, etc., we'll define one extra file:

```js
// ./pieces/index.js
module.exports = {
  Pawn: require("./pawn"),
  Knight: require("./knight"),
  Bishop: require("./bishop"),
  // ...
};

// chess-board.js
var Pieces = require("./pieces");

var p = new Pieces.Pawn();
var k = new Pieces.Knight();
var b = new Pieces.Bishop();
```

When we `require("./pieces")`, Node will realize that `./pieces` is a
directory, not a file. Node will look for a file named
`index.js` in `./pieces` and load it. The code we wrote in
`./pieces/index.js` loads more files, and exports all the classes
grouped in a single object. In `chess-board.js`, we assign this to the
variable `Pieces`. Sometimes we call `Pieces` a **namespace**.

## One More Thing

Node sets `module.exports` to a blank object by default. So we could
rewrite the above as:

```js
// ./pieces/index.js
module.exports.Pawn   = require("./pawn");
module.exports.Knight = require("./knight");
module.exports.Bishop = require("./bishop");
// ...
```

I like our way of reassigning the whole `module.exports` better. But
this way would also work.

## ES6 Module Syntax (NOT SUPPORTED YET)

In ES6, we can write export statements differently. These new ways of writing export statements don't work in Node, but are starting to be used in frontend development. The command `export default` is similar to `module.exports`, as shown below.

We are providing you this information only as a reference in case you encounter
this syntax online.

```js
// ./cat.js
let cat = {
  meow: "meow!"
};


export default cat;

// ./dog.js
let dog = {
  bark: 'woof!'
};

export default dog;

// ./animals.js
import cat from "./cat"; //cat is assigned to the cat object from cat.js
import cuteDog from "./dog"; //cuteDog is assigned to the dog object from 'dog.js'
//the name cuteDog doesn't have to be the same as the variable from dog.js

console.log(cat.meow); // "meow!"
console.log(dog.bark); // "woof!"
```

ES6 also allows us to export specific named functions and constants, and load them by name in other files. This allows us to export multiple different items from a single file.

```js
// ./silly.js
export const funString = "THIS IS MY FUN STRING";
export const coolString = "THIS IS MY COOL STRING";

// ./main.js
import {funString, coolString} from "./silly";
//funString and coolString were the names of items exported in main.js
console.log(funString); //=> THIS IS MY FUN STRING
console.log(coolString); //=> THIS IS MY COOL STRING
```
