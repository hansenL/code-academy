# BenchBnB Day 2

## Phase 7: React Router
* install the react router using `npm install --save --save-exact react-router@2.0.1`
  * This ensures you use that exact version, as other versions differ a bit.
* instead of using `ReactDOM.render` to directly place your `Search`
  component directly into `#content`, set up the router to render
  `Search` as the default route
* create an `App` react component that renders `{this.props.children}`, mine looked
  like this:

```javascript
  // frontend/bench_bnb.js.jsx
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

var ReactRouter = require('react-router');
var Router = ReactRouter.Router;
var Route = ReactRouter.Route;
var IndexRoute = ReactRouter.IndexRoute;
var hashHistory = ReactRouter.hashHistory;

var Search = require('./components/Search');

var App = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
        <div>
          <header><h1>Bench BnB</h1></header>
          {this.props.children}
        </div>
    );
  }
});

var Router = (
  <Router history={hashHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={App}>
      <IndexRoute component={Search}/>
    </Route>
  </Router>
);

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
  var root = document.getElementById('content');
  ReactDOM.render(Router, root);
});
```
* `this.props.children` will contain all components from nested routes.

* when your app works exactly as before we introduced the router, you
  may move on

## Phase 8: Creating Benches
### Adding a Bench Form ###
* create a new React component, `BenchForm`. This should render a simple form
  with 4 fields:
    * Description
    * Number of seats
    * Latitude
    * Longitude
* add a new column to the `benches` table, `seating`
  * this new column will store how many people can sit together on the
    bench at the same time
* create a new route, `/benches/new`, for this new `BenchForm` component
* test the route by navigating to `#/benches/new`, the map should disappear
* add a `createBench` function to the `ApiUtil`. It should make a `POST`
  request and then add the newly created bench using a new action that
  you must create
* submission of the form should run `ClientActions.createBench`
* test that this works by creating a new bench through the form before moving on

#### Navigating to the BenchForm ###

Filling in coordinates manually is a major pain. Users probably won't
even bother. Then we'll have no business and our marketing team will
hate us.

Let's make things a little easier by bringing up a new bench form when a
user clicks on the map and pre-fill it with latitude and longitude based
on where they clicked.

But how can we accomplish this? How are we going to get that data from
the map page to the new bench form? Well, the React Router has a really
useful feature here. Notably, you can encode parameters in a client-side
query string.

##### Redirecting with coordinates

Let's get down to business. Add a `"click"` handler to the map. It
should:

* Grab the coordinates from the click event.
* Use the router's [hashHistory][react-history] to redirect to the `BenchForm`
  URL...
* In order to pass the lat / lng data from the `Map` to the `BenchForm` component,
  we need to include that data in the query string.
  * First, make sure the `Map` requires the hashHistory module.

  ```javascript
    var hashHistory = require('react-router').hashHistory;
  ```

  * Then, we can use the `hashHistory#push` method to send some data in the query
    string when we click on the map.

  ```javascript
    _handleClick: function(coords){
      hashHistory.push({
        pathname: "benches/new",
        query: coords
      });
    }
  ```

Make sure that this works before moving on. You should be able to click the map and
the browser should redirect to a URL that looks something like:

  */#/benches/new?lat=37.79153217974085&lng=-122.40194320678711*

##### Pre-filling the form

  * Inside of the `BenchForm` component, pre-fill the value of the lat/lng
    input fields by accessing `this.props.location.query`
  * Also make sure the lat/lng input fields are disabled so that users can't edit them

Awesome! Now users can easily create new benches to their hearts'
content. Hopefully that will keep the marketing team off our backs.

## Phase 9: Front End User Authentication
In this phase, we are going to implement front-end user sign-up and login. Goodbye Rails views; hello, single-page app! Read the instructions for this whole phase first, before building anything. This will give you context to understand each individual step.

At the end of the day, we want to have methods to create users, log users in, see who's logged in, log them out, and restrict access to certain `Route`s based on whether someone is logged in. Now read the rest of the phase before starting on this.

### 1. Build Your Backend.
You should already know how to do this. Create a `User` model, `UsersController`, and `SessionsController`. The big difference is that now your controllers will be in the Api namespace (ie: `Api::SessionsController < ApplicationController`), and they will render json.jbuilder views instead of rendering html views or redirecting. 

[rails]: ../../../rails#readings-after-you-finish-all-videos

Follow the pattern you used during the [Rails curriculum][rails], keeping in mind the following: 
  * Your controllers should live under an `Api` namespace now and return JSON formatted responses.
  * We only care about one user (the current user), so adjust your routes and controllers accordingly (i.e. you have a single user `resource`, not `resources`).
  * `Sessions#show` should render the `current_user` if she or he exists.
    * We'll use this to see who's logged in
    * Make an api/users/show.json.jbuilder
  * If any auth errors arise (e.g. 'invalid credentials' or 'username already exists'), render those errors in your response with a corresponding error status.
    * You can `render json: ["error 1", "error 2"]`
  * Protect your Rails actions the way we always have, especially any API routes that send down data.
    * `before_action :do_some_stuff, only: [:this_action, :that_action]`

### 2. Build Your Frontend
Set up the following flux architecture components.
####SessionApiUtil
  * `#login` and `#logout` via AJAX!
    * AJAX calls like any other. Remember you might need the credentials in the `Api::SessionController`, so have to send those.
  * `#fetchCurrentUser`
    * AJAX request to `Api::SessionsController#show`
    * `render "api/users/show.json.jbuilder"` of the `current_user`
  * Make sure the response is what you expect in the `success`
    * No need to render anything in `Api::SessionsController#destroy`. `render json: {}` is fine.
  * Attach it to the window to test out in the console. Call `SessionApiUtil#login`. You should see the request in the Network tab in Developer Tools, also in the `rails server`. Make sure the response in the Network tab contains the json for the currentUser.

####SessionStore 
  * Keep track of a `_currentUser`
  * Keep track of a boolean of whether `_currentUserHasBeenFetched`
  * I would set this to `{}` if there isn't a user
  * `#isUserLoggedIn` should return a boolean of whether a user is logged in
    * hint: you can check `_currentUser.id`
  * `#currentUser`
  
####SessionActions
  * `receiveCurrentUser`
    * should dispatch to `SessionStore`
  * `removeCurrentUser`
    * Dispatches to `SessionStore` to reset `_currentUser`, logging them out
  * Once you have this, attach the store and `SessionApiUtil` to the window to test it out. Make sure it works before moving forward. You should be able to `#login` from the console and then see `SessionStore#currentUser`.

####UserApiUtil
  * `#signup` a user
    * Goes to `Api::UsersController#create`
    * Can use the same `render "api/users/show.json.jbuilder"` as the SessionsController!
    * On success, call `SessionAction#receiveCurrentUser` so store also knows they're logged in.

### 3. Create a LoginForm
Create a `LoginForm` component and make a front-end route for it. 

  * Render a form for users to enter their username and password. 
  * `onSubmit`, call your `SessionApiUtil#login` and pass in the credentials 
  * After they log in, send them back to the root (`/`) 
    * hint: In `#componentDidMount`, register a listener with the `SessionStore`. When the store `__emitChange`, check if user is logged in, and if so, send them to the root (`this.context.router.push("/")`).
    * User will then be at the root, but still have no way of telling they're signed in. We'll deal with that later.
  * Now also make a signup form component that calls `UserApiUtil#signup`

#### Errors
Let's display errors in case users enter bad data into the forms and fail validations/authentication.
  
  * Make an `ErrorStore`
    * Keep track of `_errors` and `_form`. The store should only ever have the errors for a single form.
    * You have 2 options for what _errors should look like. You can keep track of `errors.full_messages`, (ie: `_errors === ["Username has already been taken", "Username is too short (minimum is 4 characters)", "Password is too short (minimum is 6 characters)"]`) or by field, ie: 

        ```
        _errors === {
          username: [
            "has already been taken", 
            "is too short (minimum is 4 character)"
          ],
          password: [
            "is too short (minimum is 6 characters)"
          ]
        }
        ```
        
  * Make `ErrorActions#setErrors` and `#clearErrors`. Call these in the error callback for `SessionApiUtil#login` and `UserApiUtil#signup`.
    * hint: the first argument to $.ajax#error is the xhr. Check in there for the error data you sent back from the server
    * Make sure you're rendering relevant errors from your controllers. If you decide to keep track of errors by field, `render json: @user.errors` works great!
  * Make your `LoginForm` listen to your `ErrorStore` on `#componentDidMount`. When the store changes, re-render and include any errors you might need to display on the form. Check the `ErrorStore#form` to make sure the errors in the are for the `LoginForm`. 
    * If you choose to store errors by field, you can display them nicely alongside each field.
    
### 4. Create a greeting in the header
Let's let users know who is currently signed in.

  * In the `App` component, render a `<header>` with information about the `SessionStore#currentUser`
  * If user is logged in, display their username and a logout button.
    * `onClick` of logout button, `preventDefault` and `SessionApiUtil#logout`
  * If user IS NOT logged in, give them links to "#/login" and "#/signup"

### 5. Protect your front-end routes
Let's make sure users can't get to our "/benches/new" or "benches/:id/review" routes on the frontend if they're not logged in. We're going to use react-router's `onEnter` hooks to accomplish this. 

  * Add on `onEnter` prop to the Routes we want to protect (ie: `<Route path="something" onEnter={ _ensureLoggedIn } />`).
  * Define the `_ensureLoggedIn function`. It can be right in bench_bnb.jsx. It won't be big.
  * At this point, just put a `debugger` in there and make sure that you hit it when you try to navigate to that route. Your onEnter hook will be called whenever you navigate to the route. Check out the `arguments` it gets.
  * The hook gets 3 arguments, passed in by the ReactRouter.
    * 1st argument: next state. We won't use this one today.
    * 2nd: `replace` function. This function replaces the current path with another one you give it. We can use this to redirect them to another route (ie: `replace("/login")`)
      * The reason it's called "replace" and not "redirect" or "push" is because it replaces the current entry in the browser's history. The browser keeps track of all the paths the user visits in it's history, for the "forward" and "back" buttons to work. By replacing the current history entry, we're saying "hey browser, the user didn't actually go to /benches/new. They're going to /login."
    * 3rd: `asyncCompletionCallback`: By defualt, the Router is going to instantiate the component for the route and render it right away after the `onEnter` hook is done. The problem in this case, is that we might have to do an async AJAX request to `#fetchCurrentUser` to see if anybody is logged in before we can know whether to `replace` or not. In the meantime, we don't want to render the component. The Router gives us this third argument. If our onEnter hook takes 3 arguments in it's signature, then the Router will wait until we call it before continuing, whether by `replace`ing or continuing to the original route.
  * In your `_ensureLoggedIn`, check wether `SessionStore#currentUserHasBeenFetched`. 
    * If they haven't been fetched, `SessionApiUtil#fetchCurrentUser`. Give it a callback that runs on success and checks if now `SessionStore#userIsLoggedIn`. If they're not, `replace` and send them to "/login"
      * Don't forget to call the `#asyncCompletionCallback`.
    * If they have already been fetched before, check if they're logged in. If they are not, `replace` to "/login" and call the `#asyncCompletionCallback`.
    * Hint: the callback to `#fetchCurrentUser` and what you do when they already have been fetched are the exact same thing. Time to refactor!


## Phase 10: Filtering By Seating
### FilterParams store ###
* create a new store for the filter params. This will contain the data about the bounds and the min and max seating params.
* it should store this information as a POJO with keys of the param name and values of the param's value.
* make a new `filter_actions.js` file to contain the actions relevant to the filter store.
* your filter store should register a callback with the dispatcher and update it's data according to the action that was dispatched
* your search component should hold the params as part of it's state and register a change listener on the filter params store so that it re-fetches the benches when the params in the FilterParams store changes.
* refactor your map component to use a FilterParams action to change the FilterParams store when the map idles
*  the search component should listen to the filter params store for a change event and update it's state to always contain the current parameters.
* the search component should also re-fetch the benches when the filter params store emits a change event
* your ApiUtil function should get the current params from the FilterParams store when it is called and make a get request using the params as a query string
* once you can properly change the benches in the index by moving the map, move on to the FilterParams component.

### FilterParams component ###

* create a new React Component that will be used to filter benches by
  seating
* this should be a child component of the Search view (not a child route, but a child component) and have a field for minSeats and a field for maxSeats
* when the user changes the values of the fields in the component, call one of the filter actions you wrote to update the FilterParams store with the new values
* when the FilterParams store is update and emits a change event, this should cause the Search component to update its state and fetch the benches with the current params
* when the response from the server comes back with the new benches, this should cause the index to re-render displaying the filtered benches
* move on when you can filter by number of seats

## Phase 11: Show Page
* when the bench is clicked on in the index, you will now show the Show
  page which is a page dedicated to a single bench
* clicking a marker on the map search view should also navigate to the
  show page
* create a new component for your show page
* create a new route that will render your new component into the App component's `{this.props.children}`
* this component should have the information about the bench as well as a map with a marker for the single bench
* you will want to nest a map component inside of the showPage component's render function, and make sure this bench ends up in the map's `props`
* center the map on the single bench and prevent the map from being dragged

## Phase 12: Reviews
* on the show page, a user should be able to add reviews
* create a new component for the review form
* create a new route that is nested under the show page route to render this component
* update your show page to either render the new review component or a link to the new route
* change the showPage component to either render the nested route component for the form or a link to the route for the form
* you will also have to add reviews to your backend. They have a text body and a score from 1 to 5
* in the index, show the average score for each bench

## Phase 13: Pictures!
* when you create a new bench, allow a user to also add a photo using
  [Cloudinary][cloudinary-js]!
* you will need to create a new column in your benches table
* display these pictures on both the show page and the index

## Bonus
* every bench can have multiple photos
* show page should have a carousel
* display the score as a list of star images!
* users can favorite benches
