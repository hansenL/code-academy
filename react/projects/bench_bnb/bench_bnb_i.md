# Bench BnB

## Setup Checklist
Feel free to use the master checklist for reference during Bench BnB and during your final project.

* [Checklist](../../readings/checklist.md)

## Phase 0: Rails Backend
* Create a new rails project using Postgres and **skipping Turbolinks.**
* Make a `Bench` model with `description`, `lat` and `lng`
* `lat` and `lng` should be of type `float`
* Make a JSON api for this resource, it will need `index` and `create`
* Make some seed data with real coordinates in SF using
  `seeds.rb`

## Phase 1: Flux Structure
* Create a frontend folder at the root of your project to contain your frontend
  code
* `npm install --save react react-dom flux`
* Make a `StaticPagesController`, have it serve a root view with a
  `#content` `div`

```
frontend
  + actions
  + components // all React components, both views and controller-views
  + constants
  + dispatcher
  + stores
  + util
  bench_bnb.jsx
```
* Create the folders such that your assets folder resembles the diagram
  above
* These folders will store all of our front end goodies
* Create the dispatcher file as follows:

```javascript
//dispatcher/dispatcher.js
var Dispatcher = require('flux').Dispatcher;
module.exports = new Dispatcher();
```
* This file will now create and export a new Dispatcher

## Phase 2: The Bench Store and Web API
#### Bench Store
* We will now start building the pieces necessary for us to display a
  basic benches index using React components
* Start by making a BenchStore
* This object should provide access to all the client side benches
* Make a local variable, \_benches, that will hold all of our bench objects.
  * This should be a javascript object, where the key is the benchID and the
    value is the bench object


```javascript
//stores/bench.js
var Store = require('flux/utils').Store;
var AppDispatcher = require('../dispatcher/dispatcher');
var _benches = {};
var BenchStore = new Store(AppDispatcher);

BenchStore.all = function () {
  return Object.assign({}, _benches);
};

window.BenchStore = BenchStore; //Just for testing

module.exports = BenchStore
```
We require the `Store` class from the `flux` npm module and then create a new
store by passing in our `AppDispatcher`. This links the store to the dispatcher
so it will receive actions that are dispatched.

[Flux Utils Docs](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils.html#content)

* All this store can do is return all the benches it currently contains
* We are going to temporarily export the BenchStore to the window so we can test
  it in the console before we get our components working

#### Api Utility
* Next, lets make a utility function, `api_util.js` to help us populate this store with
  content from the server

```javascript
//util/api_util.js
ApiUtil = {
  fetchBenches: function(){
    //make an api call using AJAX in here
  }
}

window.ApiUtil = ApiUtil; //Just for testing

module.exports = ApiUtil;
```

* The success callback of the AJAX will contain all the bench objects,
  but how do we insert them into our store? Refer to [the flux diagram][flux-diagram].


* As we can see, the only thing that can change a store is the
  Dispatcher, and the way the Dispatcher interacts with the store is
  through actions


#### Actions

##### Constants
* Before we can create an action we need a constant to name the action
* Constants are important because they ensure we see error messages if we ever
  misspell an action type.
* Create a new file, `constants/bench_constants.js`

```javascript
BenchConstants = {
  BENCHES_RECEIVED: "BENCHES_RECEIVED",
}

module.exports = BenchConstants;
```
* This will be the _name_ of the action

##### Back to the Action
* Let's start by assessing how we want to build our ApiUtil <--> ActionCreators structure.
  * If we only make two files, they can't require each other! So things can get tricky...
  * Take a look at the slightly more detailed flux diagram:

    ![better-flux-diagram](assets/better_flux_structure.png)

* Let's create two files in our actions folder: `client_actions.js` and `server_actions.js`
  * `client_actions` will be responsible for triggering api calls and dispatching client-side actions
  * `server_actions` will be called from `api_util` after our ajax requests have completed. This will trigger dispatches with data from the server.
* Both of these files can communicate with the dispatcher, but they will help clean up our Actions <--> ApiUtil structure.
* `client_actions` will require `api_util`, and `api_util` will require `server_actions`
* Inside of `server_actions`, create an object and give it a `receiveAll` function
* `receiveAll` should dispatch an object with an `actionType` of
  `BenchConstants.BENCHES_RECEIVED`

```javascript
var AppDispatcher = require('../dispatcher/dispatcher');
var BenchConstants = require('../constants/bench_constants');
ServerActions = {
  receiveAll: function(benches){
    AppDispatcher.dispatch({
      actionType: BenchConstants.BENCHES_RECEIVED,
      benches: benches
    });
  }
}

module.exports = ServerActions;
```

##### Putting it all together
* In the success callback of your AJAX call in the `ApiUtil`, we can
  finally use the action we just wrote. Call `ServerActions.receiveAll` and
  pass in the benches you received as an argument.
* Call `BenchStore.all`, it's still empty, right? The Dispatcher fired
  (hopefully) but the store wasn't listening to the Dispatcher.
* Tell the `BenchStore` to listen to the dispatcher by doing the
  following
* Remember to `require` the BenchConstants

```javascript
//stores/bench.js
  var BenchConstants = require('../constants/bench_constants');

  BenchStore.__onDispatch = function (payload) {
    switch(payload.actionType) {
      case BenchConstants.BENCHES_RECEIVED:
        payload.benches.forEach(function(bench){
          _benches[bench.id] = bench;
        });
        BenchStore.__emitChange();
      break;
    }
  };

```

* Finally we should be able to test this thing. In the console, call
  `ApiUtil.fetchBenches()`. Then, `BenchStore.all()`. If it returns an
  object containing all the benches in the database we have won.
* Make sure that everything is working before moving on
* Once you've tested that it works, remove the lines from the BenchStore and
  ApiUtil that exported them to the window.

![the story so far](../../assets/api_store_diagram.png)

## Phase 3: Our First React Component
#### Emitting Events from the Store
* Return to our store, when the contents of the `BenchStore` change,
  we need to inform all interested parties that the `BenchStore` has changed.
```javascript
//stores/bench.js
  BenchStore.__onDispatch = function (payload) {
   switch(payload.actionType) {
     case BenchConstants.BENCHES_RECEIVED:
       var result = resetBenches(payload.benches);
         BenchStore.__emitChange();
         break;
    }
  };
```

Since our BenchStore is an instance of the `Flux/Utils` Store we have access to
the `addListener` method which will add a callback function to be invoked when
the store runs `__emitChange()`;

#### React Component
* Make an `Index` React component
* In `bench_bnb.jsx`, add a `ReactDOM.render` call that creates the
  `Index` and places it into the `#content` div
* Give it an initial state of `{ benches: BenchStore.all() }`
* As part of the `componentDidMount` lifecycle function, let's do two things:
  * Register a listener on the `BenchStore` using it's new `addListener` function.
    When the store changes, update the state.
  * Use your `ClientActions` to call `ApiUtil.fetchBenches`. It should look like:

  ```javascript
  //actions/client_actions.js
  var ApiUtil = require('../util/api_util');

  var ClientActions = {
    fetchBenches: ApiUtil.fetchBenches
  };

  module.exports = ClientActions;
  ```

* Here's the summary:
  * The index component calls our client-side action-creator.
  * `ClientActions` calls the `ApiUtil`, which fetches bench data.
  * `ApiUtil` then calls the `ServerActions`, which triggers a dispatch.
  * The dispatcher hits the `BenchStore`, which should cause the store to emit a change.
  * When the store changes, our `Index` component's callback function is triggered, which should set the state
    of our `Index` component.
  * When the `Index` component's state changes, it re-renders. Phew!

![complete flux loop](assets/complete_flux_loop.png)

## Phase 4: The Map
* Create a new React component, `Map`
* Its `render` function should return a `div` with class `map` and `ref`
  `map`
* In the `css` file, make sure to set the `width` and `height` of the
  `.map` to `500px`
* Read [the google maps documentation][google-map-doc]
* Get a new API key for a JavaScript Google Map
* Add a script tag including your API key to your `application.html.erb`
  * When including the google script tag, be sure to put it above `yield` and
    remove the `async defer` bit. This way, the script will load synchronously
    so it's guaranteed to be defined when the rest of your page loads.
* Create a new React component, `Search`
* `Search` should render a `div` with a `Map` and `Index` as children
* In `bench_bnb.jsx` render a `Search` component instead of `Index`
  at the root. This should cause the `Map` to be rendered into the page
* When the `Map` component mounts, instantiate the map as follows
* We will just use the default location of San Francisco instead of
  trying to geolocate

```javascript
    //components/map.jsx
    //...
    componentDidMount: function(){
      var mapDOMNode = this.refs.map;
      var mapOptions = {
        center: {lat: 37.7758, lng: -122.435},
        zoom: 13
      };
      this.map = new google.maps.Map(mapDOMNode, mapOptions);
    },
```

* This should cause a genuine Google Map to be rendered to the screen.  If
  you have API key issues, you may need to enable the Google Maps JavaScript
  API key.

## Phase 5: Markers on the Map
* When the `Map` component is mounted, register an event listener on
  change of the `BenchStore`
* Read about [map markers here][map-markers]
* When the event occurs, create markers for every bench in the array
* Move on when all your benches are represented by markers on the map
* One last change: since it doesn't make sense to fetch any markers from
  the API until we know where the map is, move the
  `ClientActions.fetchBenches` from the `Index` to the idle event of the map
   [read this documentation][event-doc] to learn about Google Map events
* If everything still works, move on to the next phase

## Phase 6: Filtering by Map Location

* When the map idles, we are going to use its current bounds to request
  only benches within the map bounds
* First, let's prepare the back end to search by bounds

### Back End Prep

* I wrote an `Bench.in_bounds` method that returned all the benches that
  were within the boundaries specified by the argument.

```ruby
#...
  def self.in_bounds(bounds)
  # bounds in the following format:
  # {
  #   "northEast"=> {"lat"=>"37.80971", "lng"=>"-122.39208"},
  #   "southWest"=> {"lat"=>"37.74187", "lng"=>"-122.47791"}
  # }
  #... query logic goes here
  end
#...
```

* In the controller, we can expect that these boundaries will be passed
  in as a query string and therefore available in the `params` hash
* Instead of rendering `Bench.all` we can instead use
  `Bench.in_bounds(params[:bounds])`

### Sending the Correct Params
* So now our back end is expecting a `GET` request to the `index`
  including a query string, so we must now furnish this request
* Return to our map `idle` event handler. Call `getBounds` on the map
  instance to get a `LatLngBounds` instance. Call `getNorthEast` and
  `getSouthWest` to get these coordinate pairs. Get their latitude and
  longitude and format these coordinates into exactly the format our back
  end is expecting. Check [this documentation][lat-lng-docs] for more
  info.
* Now, armed with an object containing the current bounds of the map, we
  can use this object in our AJAX call
* Pass this bounds object we have created as an argument to
  `ApiUtil.fetchBenches`. Inside `fetchBenches` we can now pass this
  argument to our AJAX call so it can be used as a query string
* Verify that when the map moves the correct request including the query
  string is being sent to the server, and the server is responding with
  the correct benches. The `Index` React component should be correctly
  updating with `benches` being added and removed as the map is dragged

### Adding and Removing Markers
* So the map move causes the store to emit a change event, but the map
  needs special treatment. When we detect that the contents of the store
  have changed, we should find out if any markers need to be added or
  removed.
* When a change event occurs, figure out which benches in the store have
  markers representing them on the map. Those without markers should
  have markers created and added. Markers for benches NOT in the store
  should be removed.
* This is expected to be a somewhat difficult problem
* When the only markers on the map are those appearing in the index, you
  may move on

![map bounds diagram](assets/map_idle_diagram.png)

## BONUS!
* When you hover over an index item it should highlight the marker on
  the map. This should require creating a new store.

* Look at your app, then look at the real AirBNB. See any differences?
  Give your project a makeover and add a ton of CSS so that it resembles
  the REAL AirBNB.
