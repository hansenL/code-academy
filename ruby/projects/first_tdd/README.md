# Test Driven Development

**Expected time: 2hrs.**

* Do these [Array exercises][array-exercises] TDD.
    * That means writing specs alongside code.
    * For Towers of Hanoi, don't worry about testing the UI. Testing
      console I/O is tricky (don't bother checking `gets` or `puts`). Focus on:
        * `#move`
        * `#won?`
    * Make sure to get a code review from a TA once you're done.
